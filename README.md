<h1>Polynomial Minimizer</h1>
<p>Deploying the Gradient Descent algorithm to minimize n-dimensional polynomials. Utilized the backtracking line search and Golden-section search algorithms and analyzed the performance of the algorithms through computing the standard deviation, averages, and min/max of the computation time, the number of iterations undergone, and best gradient norm obtained.</p>
